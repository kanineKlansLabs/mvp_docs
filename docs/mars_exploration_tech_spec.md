# Mars Exploration Game - Technical Specification

## **1. Overview**

This document outlines the technical specifications for the Mars Exploration Game, a browser-based 3D game with blockchain-integrated assets.

## **2. Tech Stack**

### **Frontend** (Game Client)

- **Framework:** Next.js (React-based for SSR & CSR optimizations)
- **Rendering Engine:** Three.js (WebGL-powered 3D visualization)
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS (for a scalable and responsive UI)
- **State Management:** Redux (to handle game state and interactions)
- **Language:** TypeScript (for type safety and maintainability)
- **Authentication:** JWT-based user authentication

### **Backend** (Game Server)

- **Framework:** Node.js with Express
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (to store user progress, inventory, and leaderboard data)
- **API:** RESTful APIs for handling player actions, leaderboard, and game logic
- **Authentication:** OAuth2/JWT for session management
- **Hosting:** AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, or a containerized deployment using Docker/Kubernetes

### **Blockchain Integration Server**

- **Framework:** Node.js with Express
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (to maintain NFT ownership records and token transactions off-chain)
- **Blockchain API Integration:**
  - **NFT Handling:** Backend manages NFT minting, transfer, and inventory assignment
  - **Token Management:** Handles in-game economy using $KK tokens
  - **Access Control:** Enforces blockchain-based user permissions
- **Smart Contract Alternative:** Since the blockchain doesn’t support smart contracts, all logic will be handled in the backend, interacting with the blockchain’s built-in functionalities (token, NFT, access control)

## **3. Game Mechanics**

- **Player Movement:**
  - Rover navigation with smooth physics
  - Terrain interaction (hills, craters, and obstacles)
- **Collectible Objects:**
  - Items spawn randomly and regenerate daily
  - Each item has a significance affecting player rankings
  - Items are minted as NFTs and stored in player inventory
- **$KK Token Collection:**
  - Players pick up $KK tokens on the map
  - Tokens are recorded in the blockchain and visible in the player's wallet
- **Inventory System:**
  - UI displays collected NFTs and tokens
  - Items affect game performance (speed boost, exploration range, etc.)
- **Leaderboard & Competitive Features:**
  - Players are ranked based on object significance and $KK tokens
  - Daily resets to encourage replayability

## **4. Deployment & Infrastructure**

### **Frontend**

- Hosted on Vercel for fast CDN distribution
- Next.js SSR for efficient rendering

### **Backend & Blockchain Integration Server**

- Hosted on AWS using Docker
- PostgreSQL hosted on AWS RDS
- Load balancing with AWS loadbalancer
