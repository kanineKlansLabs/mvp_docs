# Milestone 1: Development and Blockchain Integration Plan

## **Project Overview**

**Project Name:** Kanine Klans
**Description:** Mars Terrain Exploration Game  
**Category:** Web3 Gaming Platform  
**Milestone:** Pre-Alpha (Milestone 1)  
**Blockchain:** [Diamante](https://www.diamante.io/)
**SDK Used:** [Diamante SDK](https://developers.diamante.io/)

## **Objective**

Milestone 1 focuses on developing the core game mechanics, integrating blockchain for secure transactions and asset management, and community building. To enhance user experience, blockchain interactions will be abstracted, ensuring seamless gameplay without requiring players to manually sign transactions.

## **Key Components**

### **1. Architecture Finalization**

We aim to create a hybrid system where the game operates traditionally while leveraging Diamante blockchain for asset management and transactions. The finalized architecture will include:

- **Game Client:** Built using Unity Game Engine.
- **Backend Server:** Node.js and Express for API handling.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL to store user details, progress and assets.
- **Blockchain Integration Layer:** Server-side integration of Diamante SDK to handle transactions securely.

### **2. Blockchain Integration Approach**

Since Diamante does not support smart contracts, we will:

- Use **Diamante SDK** to facilitate secure transactions.
- Implement a **server-managed wallet system** to handle in-game assets, reducing friction for players.
- Store game assets off-chain while periodically verifying balances and ownership on-chain.
- Develop **API endpoints** to abstract blockchain operations, so gamers interact seamlessly without direct blockchain knowledge.

### **3. Encryption & Access Control**

To ensure secure asset management, we will implement:

- **Token-Gated Features:** Access control mechanisms to validate ownership of in-game assets before allowing interactions. Entry to every new terrain, usage of new props and collectiable will be authenticated with the ownership of the nft. NFT acts as the pass.
- **Private Key Encryption:** Server-side wallets will be securely encrypted. Users will be encouraged to not use the wallet for personal use apart from the gaming. Users will be made aware that our server storage the private key(to reduce game play friction). Users will be able to export there wallet.
- **Assets as NFT:** Assets like Rover skins, props, wheels, etc can be tradable as nft.

### **4. Community Building Strategy**

To build an initial player base, we will:

- Launch a **pre-alpha version** targeting **15-20K gamers**.
- Build social presence with **15K+ social media followers**.
- Run **gameplay previews, giveaways, and early access programs** to attract engagement.
- Partner with influencers and gaming communities to promote the game.

## **Technical Implementation**

### **Backend API Design\*\***

| Endpoint           | Method | Description                    |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------ |
| `/auth/login`      | POST   | Authenticate users             |
| `/wallet/create`   | POST   | Create a server-managed wallet |
| `/wallet/balance`  | GET    | Fetch user’s Diamante balance  |
| `/assets/mint`     | POST   | Mint in-game assets            |
| `/assets/transfer` | POST   | Handle asset transactions      |
| `/game/state`      | GET    | Fetch game progress            |

### **Game Flow**

1. User logs in via game client.
2. Server assigns or retrieves user’s wallet.
3. User explores terrain and collects in-game assets.
4. Assets are stored off-chain but can be validated using Diamante blockchain.
5. Transactions occur in the background using the server’s wallet system.

## **Expected Outcomes for Milestone 1**

✅ A functional **terrain exploration game** with blockchain-integrated asset management.  
✅ **Secure, abstracted blockchain transactions** ensuring a smooth gaming experience.  
✅ **Active community engagement** with 15-20K gamers and 15K+ social media followers.  
✅ **Seamless backend integration** with Diamante SDK for secure transactions.

## **Next Steps**

1. **Finalize technical documentation** and API specifications.
2. **Develop backend infrastructure** for blockchain interactions.
3. **Implement game mechanics** and ensure smooth blockchain integration.
4. **Initiate community engagement campaigns** for pre-alpha launch.

This plan ensures that blockchain integration enhances the game without disrupting user experience.
